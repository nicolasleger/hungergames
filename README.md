##  Why Hunger Games ? ##
- Because we are sympathetic of Katniss' fight against Panem.
- Open Food Facts generates a lot of photos, and we need to turn them into reliable data about food and cosmetics, at very large scale.
- We process all pictures using top OCR techniques, and get a lot of raw text and entities (logos) about the products.
- We then need to let users leverage this data to easily complete products, in a fun way, on their mobiles.
